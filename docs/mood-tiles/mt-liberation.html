      <h1>Liberation</h1>
      <p>
        This explores a quiet, grounded kind of liberation; one that's not shouted, but felt. The composition leans on a split-complementary palette: rosy reds and yellows layered over brooding grays to evoke transition, emergence, and emotional contrast. Bright tones dominate just slightly, suggesting that light doesn't just conquer darkness, but emerges from it.

      <h2>The Journal</h2>
      <p>
        This tile is meant to represent, well, liberation!
      </p>
      <p>
        And it's not necessarily liberation with a capital "L." Not <i>LIBERATION</i>, bold and centered, broadcasted almost like propoganda. It's the kind of liberation that feels more gentle. More reflective and aware of what it freed itself out of.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first, I didn't have the word in mind — and it was really the color palette that guided me  there. Its hues had a blend of energy and weight (lifting golds vs heavy grays). And their split-complementary relationship led me to conclude,
        <pre>
          "Yeah, the word 'liberation' feels right."</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        Visually, and emotionally, because the word relates to freedom, I think communicating the sense that structures were being dismantled would be appropriate for the aesthetics. And with the colors, arguably the most immediate part of any visual work, I needed to demonstrate some causal, contrasting relationship between the lighter tones and the more brooding ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        And to do so, I thought the brighter, lifting tones should occupy more proportional area than the darker ones. Since then, it wouldn't feel like it's "bright" all the time. There should be enough light to dominate the picture — even if it's like a 60:40 ratio — but not so much that it feels like it's super spacious, or without tension. Since, considering the word, it's that very tension — the tugging between two opposing forces — that match to the weightyness of liberation.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the topic of proportions and area: shapes themselves and how we organize them are integral to delivering the right message. And after some tinkering and testing, I figured that having a loud strip of color that goes the entire row would look good on top. In this case, the rosy-red was that strip, and it, alongside the yellow, become a sort of blanket that rests upon the darker colors. And that overlaying organziation can suggest a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
        It can imply importance, recency (things placed on top are typically the most recent), dominance, and even symbolic elements of real life. In this case, because the rosy red and yellow are on top of everything else, they could be seen as a kind of sky; and given their warm colors, perhaps either dusk or dawn — a transitional period.
      </p>
      <p>
        But of course! This is only one interpretation. And regardless of the many interpretations someone could make, ultimately, it comes down to pure, unbridled feeling. And to me, if I flipped the colors, it would simply just <i>feel wrong</i>. Or, at least, it would be less accurate to what I felt when I hear the word — think of the word — 'liberation.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Shifting from the bubbling highs and down to the weighted tones, there is that sliver of gray that spans two rows on the left. However, it's not too large, and its neighboring color, the yellow, with its overwhelming size, implies an ascendance of energy. And implications carry a "before and after," "A to B," "past and present." And here, it also carries a very simple narrative: light did struggle, light then contends, but now, light quietly emerges.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>(On a side note that isn't really a side note, but I'm too #lazy to find a way to fit this in.)</i> The gray spanning two rows on the left gently breaks the grid-like layout, which, again, serves the word well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway! The point —
      </p>
      <p>
        The <i>point</i>... is that in both directions, vertical or horizontal, there's a sense of transition, off-kilterness — a feeling that something's toppling over, or more simply, just tipping. Going back to our tall and gray lanky "lamp post," the height difference between it and the stumpy, low charcoal square right next to it communicates imbalance. Maybe even difference, change, or displacement; seeing as, it looks displaced in the same way a photo of water in a bottle, flat and unmoving, is considered stable. While, on the other hand, a photo of water sloshing around, tilted and diagonal, is more unsettled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless, all of this 'spatial politics' serves to convey the very idea of 'liberation.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, moving onto the last step I did. The final element worked on was the text itself. I made it all lowercase, almost as if it was hushed. And instead of placing it directly in the center, it's slightly elevated and positioned to the right. Because of this, the eyes will move across the picture where ever you start.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it's starting left, where you have to ride the horizon to the right, or starting at the bottom, where you have to rise to the word, there's always a sense of motion and change.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, I didn't want the text to be floating in a wispy, dreamy sense, which is why it's placed directly on top of that horizon line between the red and yellow. In fact, it's slightly sitting into the yellow so that the text peeks out — or rises out. It gives the impression that the word is a result, not just a loud statement. That it is true, not simply convincing or credible. And while it is smaller in size than those around it, the word liberation typically comes from a force that was inevitable. And in this case, the text peeks from the largest emotional and spatial field in the picture: the yellow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where now, yellow is the warmth — the energy — the cause. And the text, nestled right on top of it, simply becomes the breath after such holding.
