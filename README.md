Mood Tiles

This page currently hosts a simple, visual piece created by me during my Color Theory class, but recreated using CSS' display: grid property. Very fun, and from a few dozen pixel shifts to hundreds, still responsive. It looks nice on the phone as well, as the visual work fits into a vertical orientation.

It also has a written article and description of the visual work. A lot of it is me explaining my thought process on what went into it. And, since it is a longer piece of text, formatting it to look good and be readable was a large part of the coding. Heavily inspired by websites like Medium.com and Substack.com, it's easy on the eyes on computers and, particularly, phones. I'm pretty proud of how nicely it looks on them, and it was worth the extra effort.

As I developed the visual piece and wrote down its description, I slowly envisioned Mood Tiles as a kind of museum website, where it can link you to individual pages hosting my pieces of art. Since I already had this one hosting the word 'liberation', I think it would be cool if I added another page! Already, I shifted from my originally purely internal CSS to an external CSS. While there is still internal CSS, that's purely for the unique visual work displayed there.

It was very fun to work on, and I'm sure I'll use/refine what I coded for the articles in future, reading-focused projects.
