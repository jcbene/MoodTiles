mood tiles

This currently is a page that hosts a visual piece made during my Color Theory class but recreated using display: grid. Very fun, and a lot more responsive, looks nice on phone as well, as the visual work morphs its width to fit on the vertical orientation.

It also has a written article and description of the visual work. A lot of it is me explaining my thought process. Because it's an article, coding it to look good and actually readable is very important. Heavily inspired by websites like medium.com
